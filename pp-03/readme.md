1. A monochromatic color palette for a site introducing a new console gaming platform

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=14n0Q0k2l5x1-jL1Qd6a33niY4Q
Your Rationale: I chose these colors, going with black and gray. These colors represent power, elegance, composure, and maturity.
Which seems like the best colors when unveiling a new gaming console platform.

2. An adjacent color palette for announcing springtime tours at the Chicago Botanical Gardens

Your Palette URL:http://paletton.com/#uid=52P0u0kHEsImRyUxoBRN6n-Ssi6
Your Rationale: Well If it is Spring we need bright colors. I went with bright greens and yellows. These represent growth, nature, refreshment, balance, happiness, etc. I just wanted to give it a Spring theme. It seemed to fit. Maybe I would of added a color that was more informative, but i believe my selection is alright.

3. A triadic color palette for styling the login page for an app for kids to learn the alphabet

Your Palette URL:http://paletton.com/#uid=32C0s0kHEsImRyUxoBRN6n-Ssi6
Your Rationale: The rationale for this page, Is to use bright colors. Dull ones might lose thier attention, while bright ones don't. I decided to use colors that represent growth, fun, and wisdom. The sight is a fun mess of colors, which I think kids would enjoy while learning thier letters.

4. A custom color palette for advertising a course on cybersecurity

Your Palette URL:http://paletton.com/#uid=b3G0r1k1k++wpxRWk+vUQ++pC+Tjhk9TdC6Ij-6FhphscEjacXk00a302n100gF0b1nay1z
Your Rationale: My rationale for this website, was to combine dark colors, with blue. Blue is the color of trust, security, and  knowledge. Which all go well with a course on cybersecurity. Course the colors gray and black go very well with this also, as this is about a form of Technology.
