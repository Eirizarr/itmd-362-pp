HCI Guidline One (URL):https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/visual-design/adaptivity-and-layout/

How you implemented it in your sketch:
Since, the login is the main reason for this page, I made it aparent on the page that this was important.
I made it larger to convey that it is important. This will apply on mutliple mobile devices
and ipads. It also will be a similar layout in landscape or protrait. Make that login big.

HCI Guidline Two (URL):https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/app-architecture/navigation/

How you implemented it in your sketch:
I made navigation much more simple for the user, than just searching the page for links. I added a navigation bar at the tp of the page.
that will then send them to different pages such as Support Info, Policies, and services. This is way better than the current version where you
have to scroll through the page looking for links. I also condensed the content into a tab bar, that the user can pull out or get
rid of by clicking on it. To give them the option to look at more info or not. This is all to make the app more user friendly and let
them find information quickly.

HCI Guidline Three (URL):https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/app-architecture/loading/

When a user enters thier data they schould be able to see if it worked or not. If a user entered thier info correctly, they will see
a loading or spinner showing that the login page is loading your information, to show the screen is not frozen.
